You need to have [SDK](Get-the-prebuilt-SDK-from-GH-actions.md) installed in `/opt/miyoo` directory

- set environment variables inline with SDK location:

export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-
```
- build kernel
```
make miyoo_defconfig
make
make dir-pkg
```

## Build kernel using docker with MiyooCFW Toolchain:

```
docker run --volume ./:/src/ -it miyoocfw/toolchain-shared-uclibc:latest
cd /src
make miyoo_defconfig
make
make dir-pkg
```
